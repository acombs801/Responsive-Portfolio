                Hi! I'm Adrian, and this is my first website!! I am currently attending a 
                Full Stack development Boot Camp through UC Davis, which is where I've learned how to create 
                a website such as this! I hope to finish this class with a certificate and further improve my 
                skills as a developer, so hopefully one day I'll be working for Google! (I wish).

            <p class="content">
                As you now know my name is Adrian Combs, I am from a small town called Winters, I've lived in 
                Northern California my whole life. I will be 24 in July (whoop, whoop), and hope to have a career 
                in the Tech industry by the time I'm at least 30, so that definitely gives me plenty of time to expand 
                my skills and become a real pro in the language of coding... at least I hope haha. Starting Coding 
                was definitely a whole new experience for me, it may be very confusing at times as well as be quite 
                overwhelming, but I hope to power through it and have the skills that will pave the way for my future!
